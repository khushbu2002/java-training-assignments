 // question 2 :
  /* example names according to standard naming convension
  *  i) Class:- First letter of the name for the class should be Capital and the rest alphabets should be small
  *		example: CalciWorking , Hobby.
  *	ii) Function name : Every function should have their identifiers's first letter small and if there are multiple words , is should be named in camel case form,
  *		example: nameAndAge() , method(). 
  *		note : function name should always be followed by round brackets '()' ;
  *	iii) variable:- Variables will always be written as first letter small (similar to functions) but the difference is that variables do not use '()' brackets at the end of their identifiers.
  *			example: myName , my_name.
  iv) Static variable: Static variable will always be named in all caps seperated by underscore
  *			example : MY_STATIC_VARIABLE, STATIC_VAR

  /* question 3
	i) ans: .java file is the file which contains the source code 
	this file cannot be executed
	---> .class file is the executable file of .java file
			after the compilation of .java file, the .class file is formed.
	ii) Java is not purely OOP'as programming language because of primitive data types.
	peimitive data types need not to be formed with the help of classes and objects.
	althought concept of wrapper classes also exists,
	iii) Example of NR-WA method
		void add2Integers (int a, int b) {
			int total = a + b;
			System.out.println("prints additon of 2 integers : " total);
		}

  /* Question 5 : 
  Wrapper classes are the classes of primitive data types by which primitaive data tives wille be defined with the help of class ad objects.
  for example: Integer i = 20; where Integer is the class which contains integer type objects and i is the object of classs containg value i.
  when we define a primitive data into its corresponding wrapper class it is know as autoboxing 
  opposite of Autoboxing is known as AutoUnboxing.
